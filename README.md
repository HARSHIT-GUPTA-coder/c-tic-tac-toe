C++ tic tac toe player

This is basically a non-graphic version of the famous game: TIC TAC TOE. 
The program allows you to play in single player and multi player mode. Also, you can set the difficulty(though you will have to do it in the code).

The computer basically predicts its next move by actually playing the game for some defined moves(based on the difficulty or level) and selecting the one in which the chances of winning is max.
