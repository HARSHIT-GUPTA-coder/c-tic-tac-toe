# c-tic-tac-toe
C++ tic tac toe playing program (coded in Turbo C++,so uses conio.h and previous C++ standards)

This is basically a non-graphic version of the famous game: TIC TAC TOE. 
The program allows you to play in single player and multi player mode. Also, you can set the difficulty(though you will have to do it in the code). It also allows you to save the game in a file.

The computer basically predicts its next move by actually playing the game for some defined moves(based on the difficulty or level) and selecting the one in which the chances of winning is max.
